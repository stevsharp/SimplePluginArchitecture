## Simple Plugin Architecture
Simple Plugin Architecture is a lightweight framework for building extensible applications using a plugin-based architecture.

## Overview
The Simple Plugin Architecture allows developers to extend the functionality of their applications by dynamically loading and integrating plugins at runtime. It provides a simple and flexible way to add new features or modify existing ones without modifying the core application code.

## Features
Dynamic loading of plugins
Plugin discovery and instantiation
Plugin lifecycle management
Versioning and compatibility support
Getting Started
To get started with Simple Plugin Architecture, follow these steps:

## Clone the Repository: Clone the SimplePluginArchitecture repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/stevsharp/SimplePluginArchitecture.git
Build the Solution: Open the solution in your preferred IDE (Visual Studio, JetBrains Rider, etc.) and build the solution to compile the code.

Create Plugins: Create one or more plugins by implementing the IStartup interface provided by Simple Plugin Architecture. Each plugin should be compiled into a separate assembly (DLL).

Configure the Host Application: Configure your host application to use Simple Plugin Architecture by adding references to the necessary assemblies and implementing the logic for discovering, loading, and interacting with plugins.

Run the Application: Run your host application, and it should dynamically load and integrate the plugins you've created.

Example
Here's a simple example of how you might use Simple Plugin Architecture in your application:

## csharp
